                            Hi Meegan, My Love!
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-mainbody">
                            How's it going? Oh good? Oh hey same, I'm good thanks for asking! It's your birthday! Woah, that's crazy!? 25!? Old lady, quarter-century, amachi, 
                            now you're also a masi, who knows what will happen next ;). Anyways, happy birthday baby! Happy birthday to my cute, smart, funny, and loving girlfriend. 
                            Your 25th year was a pretty big one huh. Lots of stuff has happened over the past year and your life has changed so much. You've graduated law school, probably 
                            the toughest schooling you'll ever do, you took the bar exam, let's not even get started on that, and you're about to be a masi and aunty!! (leaving them separate 
                            just bc you know which is which). Oh also you are going to Japan and Korea (finally) with the coolest person ever!! and Bhavs Cash and Tyler. We've also had some 
                            really fun times this past year with New York (ALADDIN!) and the Dominican Republic! (I can't remember if Puerto Rico was in the past year or not so I'm not 
                            sure whether to include it in the list or not). Throughout all these experiences, good and bad, thank you for always being there with me and for me; I'm the 
                            luckiest guy ever. You're always so sweet to me and you make me feel so special. I love you more than words can describe and can't wait to spend the rest of my 
                            life with you and have many more good (and bad) experiences with you. (Even through the bad I'm glad they're with you because we can always get through it together). 
                            Anyways, honestly I don't have too too much to say that I haven't said before in previous letters. Honestly, I don't know if I can do this every year because I feel 
                            like they'll get pretty repetitive but also I know you'll never agree to me not doing it every year sigh. Feel like I got some cool other gifts, man why does this have 
                            to be basically your favorite gift. I mean its kinda cool because its personal and its something that you can always read (in my voice) and kinda feel like im there 
                            and its me telling you how much I love you and I'm not super expressive with my emotions so this is one of the few opportunities that Iet it out but yeah. Welp. I 
                            can't wait to spend your 26th year together and I hope it will be the best one yet! I love you so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so much baby!!
                        </p>

                            to have you know and really excited for this next chapter of our life. I still wont tell you any exact dates and you better not ask around to people now and/or tell anyone else besides 
                            your best friends that fine I guess. As long as they dont bring it up to me unprompted lol. WELL thats pretty much all I wanted to say I cant wait to move forward in life with you :)
