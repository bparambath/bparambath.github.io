                            Hi Baby! Happy Birthday!! I’m writing this hella late I know I know I should’ve written it sooner 
                            but I wanted to work on the main structural part before actually writing the letter and its been while 
                            so it took me awhile to figure everything out but I hope you liked it bub. I feel like I have usually written 
                            pretty similar letters like about me and you and you and me and how much I love you and such so I wanted to add a 
                            little ~extra~ to it this year and make it a little bit more memorable. ALSO I think with this it makes it a bit cooler 
                            with the addition of the old letters so if you want to reminisce and you don’t have the letters on you, you could just hop on 
                            this website and read them! Pretty cool huh. Tbh I still have some stuff to finalize on the website so I hope I have all of the 
                            features included and it looks good lol.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-mainbody">
                            ANYWAYSSS, to the main bulk of the letter. Probably the part that you wanted to read the most :). Welllll happy birthday baby! I am 
                            glad that we got to spend another whole year of your life together and looking forward to many many MANY more. My gift this year was 
                            kinda meh with the show tickets especially bc you guessed it but whatever. HOPEFULLY Saturday which is when youll probably be reading this… 
                            makes up for it. Honestly Im really looking forward to the dinner, also im really hungry while writing this so probably why I’m looking 
                            forward to the dinner. Also looking forward to seeing YOU silly haha nice. Anyways the classic, I wonder if youre reading this in my 
                            voice as you’re going through this just bc its written so casually, but also I’m probably next to you and it would be kinda weird bc 
                            its kinda like I’m reading this to you. Now I bet you probably looked at me after reading that line huh. Keep reading you fool. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-mainbody">
                            I really don’t know what to write in this letter that differs from the other previous letters sigh. I mean I could say all the reasons 
                            that I love you bc you’re literally the most perfect girl in the world for me. I could also say all of the things that I want to do with you 
                            BUT I already did both of those things. SO I’ll continue with a poem. Winter. Spring. Summer. Fall. The four seasons lived together in harmony. 
                            Then everything changed when the Meegan Nation attacked. I can’t do it. I can’t write a poem. Oh also, unless there’s a really bad spelling 
                            mistake or apostrophe missing, my rule is that there is no backspaces or deleting anything. Okay I think I’m done with the letter lol idk 
                            where to go. I love you so much baby, more than anything in the world and I cant wait to spend the rest of our lives together and spend the 
                            rest of your birthdays and our anniversaries together. Ill end off with some of the places that I want to visit in the future with you and 
                            maybe for our 3 year. Spain, London, Turkey, Korea, Thailand, Vietnam, Taiwan, Singapore, Australia/Oceania. South Africa, Egypt, 
                            South American Countries, Puerto Rico, Dominican/Haiti, NW Canada, Phoenix, Dallas, Austin, NOLA, Denver, Seattle, Portland, Chicago. India (I guess).
