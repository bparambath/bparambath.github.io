                            Hi Baby!
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-mainbody">
                            As usual, happy birthday to the one who I can call my own, my nug, my cutie, my everything. It has truly been a great year for you and us as a 
                            whole. We finally moved down to DC and now are living a life of our own down there (even were roomies for a few weeks!). I think we have taken 
                            steps in our relationship that are pivotal for our future, and I am really, REALLY happy with you. I realize now that I have taken this letter 
                            and started going on a path about us together and not really about you so we will switch it back to just about you.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-mainbody">
                            So Meegan baby, big year huh. Going into your last year of law school. Killed it in your last semester of L2 even with all the stress at the time 
                            of having to study last minute for everything (She’s just too clean). First big internship out of the way, working a big girl job with big girl 
                            responsibilities and you killed it again, enough to get a return offer for Meegan Kunnel, Esq come 2023. I (along with probably everyone else in 
                            your life) am so proud of you. I am so lucky to be able to be called your boyfriend or partner. I am so lucky to have such a beautiful, smart, 
                            talented, affectionate, dependable, ambitious, sociable, persistent, honest, loving person to call my own. Did I miss any adjectives there :). 
                            Andddd funny i GUESS lol. Baby you light up my world like nobody else. The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed. And when I smile at the 
                            ground it ain’t hard to tell. You don’t know oh-oh you don’t know how perfect you are.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-mainbody">
                            So, here’s to 24, big kobe year (RIP to one of the GOATs), and lets make this year even better. I hope we can do a lot of cool things and eat some cool 
                            foods and maybe go somewhere cool sometime. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-mainbody">
                            Here’s the list of last years places that we didn’t visit: Spain, London, Turkey, Korea, Thailand, Vietnam, Taiwan, Singapore, Australia/Oceania. South Africa, 
                            Egypt, South American Countries, Dominican/Haiti, NW Canada, Phoenix, Dallas, Austin, NOLA, Denver, Seattle, Portland, Chicago, India.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-mainbody">
                            The only one that we actually hit was PR but hey one is out of the way. This year I think we will probably hit like Dallas/Austin and with your post law school trip probably 
                            somewhere in SE Asia (idk how much of it ill be able to come to but you'll have a whole kundi adventure).
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-mainbody">
                            I love you so much.
