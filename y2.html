                            Hey Bub,
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-mainbody">
                            I guess we can say this is birthday number 2 that we get to spend together and I get to write a letter. 
                            I know that you would want me to hand write it but I mean that would be illegible, “Oh it wouldn’t matter 
                            it would mean more and it’s the thought that counts”. You’d say something along those lines but meh you know 
                            what. Deal with it. I don’t wanna. Also my hand would prob cramp bc I probably have arthritis after playing 
                            video games so much and I haven’t handwritten anything in a while. ANYWAYS you’re probably thinking, “Wow I 
                            can like read this in Benju’s voice”. Well ya probably bc again, I am just writing what I am thinking ya feel. 
                            I’m ALSO reading this in my voice (or at least my perception of my voice). 
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-mainbody">
                            Okay moving on to the eriche of this letter. I know u cant understand Malayalam so ill translate for ya. It means the 
                            “meat of this letter”. Anyways… Hi babooshka, lol jk, Hi baby I really love you so so so much and wanted to write this 
                            letter to show my appreciation to ya and your 22 years of life. I am really happy to have spent 1 year 7 months and 3 
                            days (+/- 4 days) together as of today. You make me a better person and complete me. You are my support system, my 
                            greatest resource, my confidant, my sharer in food tastes (besides taquitos), and lastly my best friend. Thanks for 
                            sticking with and working with me through the tough times so we could make it to this point and can spend the rest of 
                            our lives together. Also as im writing this, pls don’t share this w anyone. I’m writing sappy stuff jeez.
